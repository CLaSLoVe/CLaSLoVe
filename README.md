# 👋 Hi, I’m @CLaSLoVe

🌐 My homepage: [claslove.github.io](https://claslove.github.io/)

- My research interests include **Human–Computer Interaction (2020–)** and **AI for Science (2025–)**.  
- My hobbies are composing music and working out. I am also the lead guitar of [**Tokamak Disruption**](https://tokamak-disruption.netlify.app/), an alternative metal band.
- I also enjoy conducting some meaningless but interesting research (e.g. [von-Neumann-elephant](https://github.com/CLaSLoVe/von-Neumann-elephant)). 🐘

Some small tools I think macOS should ship with:  

- [`MathTeX-Vectorizer`](https://github.com/CLaSLoVe/MathTeX-Vectorizer) – Convert LaTeX math to SVG for scalable formulas.  
- [`HoldQ`](https://github.com/CLaSLoVe/HoldQ) – Prevent accidental quitting with ⌘Q by adding a “hold to quit” interaction.  
- [`BulletPaste`](https://github.com/CLaSLoVe/BulletPaste) – Sequential pasting for smoother table-filling.
