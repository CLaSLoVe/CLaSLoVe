## 📖 About Me
I have a strong interest in AI-assisted human-computer interaction and multimodal information perception. With a background in Computer Science and Mechatronic Engineering, I am committed to building smarter human-computer interaction devices and algorithms [Stack-Ada-HCI](https://github.com/CLaSLoVe/Stack-Ada-HCI).

In addition, I also enjoy conducting some meaningless but interesting research [von-Neumann-elephant](https://github.com/CLaSLoVe/von-Neumann-elephant). 🐘
